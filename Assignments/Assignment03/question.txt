1. Create an array of student objects (`name`, `dept`, `year`). Display them using `.map()` 
inside cards. 
2. Show “Welcome back!” if a variable `isLoggedIn` is true, else show “Please log in”. 
3. Create a `<ProfileCard>` component that takes props: `name`, `role`, and `image`. Use it 
three times with different data. 
4. Creatassiinput field for “Username.” When the user types, display the entered name live 
below it. 
5. Create a small form with “Name” and “Email” fields. On submit, display both values 
below without refreshing the page. 
6. Display an array of product objects (id, name, price) in a `<table>` using `.map()`. 
7. Create a parent component with a function `showAlert()`. Pass it as a prop to a child and 
call it on button click. 
8. Given a list of products (name, category), add buttons like “All”, “Electronics”, “Clothes” 
to filter and display accordingly. 
9. Create a search bar that filters and displays matching student names from an array as you 
type. 
10. Import a local `data.json` file (list of products) and display them as cards using `.map()`. 
11. Fetch data from `https://dummyjson.com/products` and display product name, price, and 
brand. 
12.Show “Loading…” while fetching, and if the request fails, show “Error loading data”. 
13. Start with an array of fruits in state. Add a form to insert new fruits dynamically into the 
list. 
14. Extend the previous question — add a delete button to remove an item from the list. 
15. Create a profile object in state (`name`, `email`, `phone`). Add inputs to edit and update 
each field. 
16. Create a form (title, body) and send data to `https://dummyjson.com/posts/add` using 
Axios POST. Display “Post Added!” message on success. 
17. Fetch one user from `https://dummyjson.com/users/1`, display details in inputs, edit and 
update using PUT. 
18. Fetch 20 users from an API and show only 5 at a time with “Next” and “Prev” buttons. 
19. Build a 3-page app — Home, About, Products — and link them using `react-router-dom`. 
20. Add a “Products” page with nested routes: `/products/electronics` and `/products/fashion`.
